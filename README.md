# scalabase

Some hopefully useful helpers in scala

To use it you need to add the following line to your build.sbt

<pre>resolvers += ("tomdom-mvn snapshots" at "https://github.com/tomdom/tomdom-mvn/raw/master/snapshots")</pre>

and add this to your library dependencies

<pre>"com.github.tomdom" %% "scalabase" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"</pre>
